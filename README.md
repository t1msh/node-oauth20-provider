node-oauth20-provider
==================

OAuth 2.0 provider toolkit for nodeJS with connect/express support. Supports all the four authorization flows: authorization code, implicit, client credentials, password.

___One more oAuth 2.0 service provider? Yes!___

- Based on the final specification *[RFC6749](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749 "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework Specification")*
- Fully customizable and extremely flexible
- Test covered
- Contains integration examples

## Installation ##

    $ npm install oauth20-provider

---------------------------------------

## Usage ##

> Look into ."/test/server/ directory" for working example with in-memory and redis storage models.

### Step 1. Define your models and decision controller ###

By default module sets abstract models which should be redefined, library does not force any implementation.

### Refresh token model ###

Refresh tokens are credentials used to obtain access tokens.  Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner). *[Read more](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5)*

___Redefinable functions___
Look at "./lib/model/refreshToken.js" for further information.

### Access token model ###

Access tokens are credentials used to access protected resources.  An access token is a string representing an authorization issued to the client.  The string is usually opaque to the client.  Tokens represent specific scopes and durations of access, granted by the resource owner, and enforced by the resource server and authorization server. *[Read more](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.4)*

___Redefinable functions___
Look at "./lib/model/accessToken.js" for further information.

### Client model ###

Before initiating the protocol, the client registers with the authorization server.  The means through which the client registers with the authorization server are beyond the scope of this specification but typically involve end-user interaction with an HTML registration form. *[Read more](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2)*

___Redefinable functions___
Look at "./lib/model/client.js" for further information.

### Code model ###

The authorization code is obtained by using an authorization server as an intermediary between the client and resource owner. User only by authorization code flow, no need to initialize it if one dont use this grant. *[Read more](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.1)*

___Redefinable functions___
Look at "./lib/model/code.js" for further information.

### User model ###

User is a registered person in the service. Model should contain unique identifier, password and sometimes additional unique key (for example username/email). There is no common scheme for this type of object, feel free to implement it your way.

___Redefinable functions___
Look at "./lib/model/user.js" for further information.

### Decision contoller ###

Page is used to ask user whether user agree or not to allow client to access his information with current scope. Controller should return POST form with decision parameter (0 - user does not allow, 1 - user allows).

___Redefinable___
Look at "./contoller/authorization/decision.js" for further information.

### Step 2. Inject and Define Endpoints ###

First of all include and initialize **oauth20-provider** library:
```js
oauth2lib = require('./oauth20-provider.js');
oauth2 = new oauth2lib({log: {level: 2}});
```

Library is compatible with express/connect servers, inject oauth2 into your server.
```js
server.use(oauth2.inject());
```

___Token endpoint___

```js
server.post('/token', oauth2.controller.token);
```

___Authorization endpoint___

```js
server.get('/authorization', isAuthorized, oauth2.controller.authorization, function(req, res) {
    // Render our decision page
    // Look into ./test/server for further information
    res.render('authorization', {layout: false});
});
server.post('/authorization', isAuthorized, oauth2.controller.authorization);
```

Middleware **isAuthrorized** is used to check user login. If user is not logged in - show authorization form instead. Simple implementation:

```js
function isUserAuthorized(req, res, next) {
    if (req.session.authorized) next();    
    else {
        params = req.query;
        params.backUrl = req.path;        
        res.redirect('/login?' + query.stringify(params));
    }         
};
```

### Step 3. Relax ###

Your authorizaton server is ready for work.

---------------------------------------

### ToDo list and future plans ###

- Add examples (mongodb, postgresql)
- Allow multiple flows for single client (only 1 per client works well yet)
- Add refresh token TTL
- Implement proper "state" support
- Implement proper "TTL" support for accessToken and scope objects
- Add MAC token type
- Allow client authentication via query parameters
- More tests
- More docs
- Build example site
- Check RFC once more
